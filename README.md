Compter Networks Questions!

## Define network 
A network is a set of devices that are connected with a physical media link. In a network, two or more nodes are connected by a physical link or two or more networks are connected by one or more nodes. A network is a collection of devices connected to each other to allow the sharing of data. 

## What do you mean by network topology, and explain types of them?
Network topology is the arrangement of nodes and links of a network.
Topologies are categorized as either physical network topology or logical network topology.
The topology of a network is key to determining its performance.
Network topology can be categorized into – Bus Topology, Ring Topology, Star Topology, Mesh Topology, Tree Topology.

## Define bandwidth, node and link?
Bandwidth is the data transfer capacity of a computer network in bits per second (Bps). The term may also be used colloquially to indicate a person’s capacity for tasks or deep thoughts at a point in time. A network is a connection setup of two or more computers directly connected by some physical mediums like optical fibre or coaxial cable. This physical medium of connection is known as a link, and the computers that it is connected to are known as nodes.

## Explain TCP model?
It is a compressed version of the OSI model with only 4 layers. It was developed by the US Department of Defence (DoD) in the 1860s. The name of this model is based on 2 standard protocols used i.e. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol).

1. Network Access/Link layer : Decides which links such as serial lines or classic Ethernet must be used to meet the needs of the connectionless internet layer. Ex – Sonet, Ethernet
2. Internet : The internet layer is the most important layer which holds the whole architecture together. It delivers the IP packets where they are supposed to be delivered. Ex – IP, ICMP.
3. Transport : Its functionality is almost the same as the OSI transport layer. It enables peer entities on the network to carry on a conversation. Ex – TCP, UDP(User Datagram Protocol)
4. Application : It contains all the higher-level protocols. Ex – HTTP, SMTP, RTP,DNS.

## Layers of OSI model!
There are majorly 2 main layers in the OSI model:
Physical Layer
Data Link Layer
